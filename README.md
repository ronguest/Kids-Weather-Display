Kids Weather Display
========

Implemented using an Arduino Yun. The Linux side fetches weather and environmental data from Weather Underground and stores it on the SD card. The Arudino side "sketch" (code) drives the display and reads the conditions from the SD card. In addition to current weather and the future forecast it rotates through a display which advises the kids on what type of clothes will be most appropriate (shorts, long sleeve, heavy jacket or etc).

This project was derived from my Weather Display project. Should have been forked or something instead of a separate copy...
